# turbine
This repository contains a program written in Python that computes the suction side and pressure side of a 2D turbine 
blade. It is the code written for the Bachelors thesis 
[Parameter selection and derivative conditions for B-splines applied to gas turbine blade modeling](http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/5010847])

##Dependencies
The code requires the library [PyNURBS](https://github.com/alexbw/PyNURBS) originally written by Runar Tenfjord and forked with
minor updates by Alex Wiltschko.
